    "This notebook analyzes the impact of course-taking order on student outcomes (e.g., GPA) at the University of Virginia. It was created in response to a question about whether students perform differently depending on the sequence in which they take certain key classesâ€”e.g., is it better to take Calculus before Linear Algebra, or the other way around?\n",

    "The code is a query-style script with plans to integrate into UVA's UBI (university business intelligence). The user inputs a list of courses to analyze, and the script outputs a violin plot which visualizes how students have historically performed in those courses with respect to the order that a course is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the violin plot, each course is followed by a number (1, 2, or 3 for example). The number corresponds to the order in the sequence in which the student took a course. If a student has two courses with the same number, that means they took those courses in the same semester."
