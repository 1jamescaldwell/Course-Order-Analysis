Summer 2025

This project analyzes the impact of course-taking order on student outcomes (GPA) at the University of Virginia. It was created in response to a question about whether students perform differently depending on the sequence in which they take certain key classesâ€”e.g., is it better to take Calculus before Linear Algebra, or the other way around?

The code is a query-style script which integrates into UVA's UBI (University Business Intelligence - QlikSense). Using a custom qlik sense app interface, the user inputs a list of courses to analyze, and the script outputs data which which visualizes how students have historically performed in those courses with respect to the order that a course is taken. The UBI and powershel scripting are not shown here, but the python script is shown here which could be used on its own or with other BI tools.

CourseOrder.py is the main script.
