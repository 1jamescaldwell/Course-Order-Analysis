7/21/25: Work in progress. 

Collaboration effort with Natalia Startseva and UBI team at UVA. 

This notebook analyzes the impact of course-taking order on student outcomes (e.g., GPA) at the University of Virginia. It was created in response to a question about whether students perform differently depending on the sequence in which they take certain key classesâ€”e.g., is it better to take Calculus before Linear Algebra, or the other way around?

The code is a query-style script which integrates into UVA's UBI (QlikSense, university business intelligence). The user inputs a list of courses to analyze, and the script outputs data which which visualizes how students have historically performed in those courses with respect to the order that a course is taken.

CourseOrder.py is the main script.
